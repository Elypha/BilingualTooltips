punchline: In case the WoL speaks more than one language
description: |
  Yes, we have tooltips displayed in two languages now. You paid SE for 4 languages so make very good use of it.

  - Interested in localised item descriptions in different languages?
  - Got fed up of transliterated カタカナ and would rather read just the original words?

  We've got you! See plugin config to customise your own experience.
